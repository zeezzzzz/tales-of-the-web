        <p>In today's tech-driven (computer-minded) world, coding has become a skill coveted (desired) by many. The
          demand for skilled coders continues to rise, but what if I told you that even someone from a completely
          different background, like commerce, finance, mechanical enginer, and so on.... can successfully transition
          into a coding career? Yes, you read that right. You don't need a computer science degree or a lifelong love
          affair with computers to excel in coding. You just need startup (a right way to start), self motivation,
          consistency, and surely a positive atitude. </p>

        <h3>Step to keep motivated</h3>
        <p>1. Schedule your goal</p>
        <p>2. Set small goals to get started and build momentum</p>
        <p>3. Accept positive peer pressure</p>
        <p>4. Monitor your progress</p>
        <p>Now, Let me share a story with youâ€”a story of transformation, Experience, passion, Expertise, and the
          relentless (strength) pursuit of a dream.</p>
        <h2>let's start with my <span class="h2-span"> journey to learn coding</span></h2>

        <h3>The Unexpected Beginning</h3>
        <p>Consider a young man who has recently graduated from college with a degree in commerce and finance. That was
          me a few years ago. My world revolved around numbers, ledgers, and financial statements. Coding was as foreign
          to me as a language from another planet. It seemed like an impenetrable fortress of binary code and
          algorithms. The mere sight of a programming language made my head spin</p>

        <h3>The Spark of Curiosity</h3>
        <p>One day, while I was diligently (in a way that is careful and uses a lot of effort) working on a financial
          report, I stumbled upon an article about web development. It was like discovering a hidden treasure chest. The
          idea of creating websites from scratch, of building something tangible and interactive, fascinated me. A spark
          of curiosity ignited (to set on fire) within me</p>

        <h3>The Journey Begins</h3>
        <p>I decided to delve (to dig) into this new world, one line of code at a time. My journey started with the
          basics: HTML and CSS. At first, it felt like learning a new language, but my determination was unwavering.
          Nights turned into mornings as I poured over online tutorials, courses, and books. There were moments when I
          felt overwhelmed, moments when it seemed impossible, but I reminded myself of my initial spark of curiosity
          and persevered</p>

        <h3>The Struggles</h3>
        <p>As I advanced, the challenges grew. Learning JavaScript and other programming languages pushed me to my
          limits. I encountered countless bugs and errors, and my frustration knew no bounds. But I had come too far to
          give up. I realized that coding, like any other skill, required patience and practice. As a beginner, everyone
          got stuck on something, which made them frustrated and demotivated, but the thing to remember is that
          everything has a time limit, As a result, doing things in a hurry will produce unfavorable results</p>

        <h3>The Turning Point</h3>
        <p>Slowly but surely, things started to click. I began to understand the logic behind the code, and debugging
          became less daunting. I realized that coding was not just about typing lines of text; it was about
          problem-solving and creativity. With each project, I gained more confidence. After deep learning JavaScript
          for 8 months as my first programming language, I managed to create my first project (a words counter), which
          gave me the boost to tackle even more complex projects. Now, the point of mentioning my first project is to
          make the suggestion that everything should begin with the basics. If you master the fundamentals, you will be
          able to adopt advance easily </p>

        <h3>Creating professional handwritten websites</h3>
        <p>Years passed, and today, I can proudly say that I create professional, handcrafted websites from scratch.
          Whether it's designing landing pages or developing e-commerce sites, I can bring ideas to life through code.
          My journey from a commerce graduate to a coder has been a testament (a statement of belief) to the power of
          passion and perseverance (dedication)</p>

        <h3>Diving Deeper into the Journey</h3>
        <p>As my coding journey progressed, I came across new programming languages and technologies that expanded my
          horizons (skyline). Learning programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and React provided access to a
          wide range of projects and applications. Each language presented its own set of challenges and rewards,
          fueling my passion and motivation while adding valuable layers to my coding abilities</p>

        <h3>If I can, so can you</h3>
        <p>Now, you might be wondering, "Why should you care about my story?" Well, it's not about me; it's about you.
          If a guy with a background in commerce can become a proficient coder, then why can't you pursue your passion,
          no matter how unrelated it may seem to your current circumstances?</p>

        <h3>Key Milestones in My Journey</h3>
        <p>My coding journey was filled with key milestones that shaped my transformation. Let's take a closer look at
          these pivotal moments:</p>

        <h4>1. Discovering the Magic of HTML and CSS</h4>
        <p>My first step into the coding world began with HTML and CSS. These foundational languages allowed me to
          create the structure and design of web pages. It was like learning to lay the bricks and paint the walls of a
          digital house. The feeling of seeing my first web page come to life was truly magical.</p>

        <h4>2. Conquering JavaScript</h4>
        <p>JavaScript, often seen as the heart of web development, presented its own set of challenges. Learning to code
          dynamically and make web pages interactive required a deeper understanding of programming logic. It was like
          adding electricity to that digital house, making it come alive with functionality.</p>

        <h4>3. Don't rush into multiple things</h4>
        <p>First and foremost, decide where to begin and what fits best for you. Never juggle multiple tasks at the same
          time. Many beginners make the mistake of starting two things at the same time, but they do not understand the
          basic concept of both. That is a key point that I recommend: try to learn one thing at a time</p>

        <h4>4. The Joy of the First Project</h4>
        <p>Creating my first project, a word counter, was a turning point. It wasn't just about learning the language;
          it was about using code to solve a real-world problem. This project was the first brick in building my
          confidence as a coder</p>

        <h4>5. Expanding Horizons with Python</h4>
        <p>Venturing into Python opened up new possibilities. Python's versatility allowed me to explore different
          realms of coding, from data analysis to automation. It was like acquiring a new toolbox with a wide range of
          specialized tools</p>

        <h3>The Importance of Community and Collaboration</h3>
        <p>My coding journey didn't happen in isolation i have a group of people I call friends. My friends inspire me
          greatly in this successful coding journey. Joining a coding community was a game-changer. Here's why it's so
          important</p>

        <h4>1. Learning from Others</h4>
        <p>In a coding community, you're surrounded by individuals at various skill levels. This diversity is a goldmine
          of knowledge. I learned valuable tips, tricks, and best practices from my peers</p>

        <h4>2. Social media in my coding journey?</h4>
        <p>Social media create a huge impact on my coding journey. I join Facebook and Whatsapp groups. Facebook has a
          large developer community that provides high-quality content for free on a daily basis. I start learning from
          other projects while also sharing my own. If my project requires clarification, then i consult with a senior
          or experienced developer who will most likely assist me many time and i have strong links with them right now
        </p>

        <h4>3. Collaborative Projects</h4>
        <p>Collaboration is at the core of coding communities. Working on projects with others not only improves your
          coding skills but also exposes you to different coding styles and problem-solving approaches</p>

        <h4>4. Finding Solutions Together</h4>
        <p>When you encounter a coding roadblock, there's a community ready to help. Online forums like Stack Overflow
          and coding communities on platforms like GitHub provide a wealth of assistance. Asking questions and offering
          solutions are integral parts of the coding journey</p>

        <h3>Staying Motivated: The Secret Sauce</h3>
        <p>Coding is a journey filled with highs and lows. Staying motivated is the secret sauce that keeps you going.
          Here are some tried-and-true motivation strategies that have helped me</p>

        <h4>1. Passion is the Driving Force</h4>
        <p>Passion is your compass on this journey. Whenever you feel stuck or demotivated, revisit why you started
          coding in the first place. Your passion is the fuel that keeps you moving forward</p>

        <h4>2. Small Wins Lead to Big Successes</h4>
        <p>Celebrate small victories along the way. Whether it's solving a tricky coding problem or completing a
          project, these small wins build your confidence and keep you motivated</p>

        <h4>3. Set Clear Goals</h4>
        <p>Having clear, achievable goals is essential. Outline what you want to accomplish in your coding journey and
          break it down into smaller, manageable steps. Each step brings you closer to your ultimate goal</p>

        <h4>4. Embrace Challenges</h4>
        <p>Challenges are opportunities in disguise. Instead of dreading errors and obstacles, see them as chances to
          learn and grow. Embracing challenges is an essential mindset for every coder</p>

        <h4>5. Learn from Others' Stories</h4>
        <p>Reading about successful coders' journeys can be incredibly inspiring. I regularly followed blogs and YouTube
          channels of accomplished coders, learning from their experiences and gaining insights into how they overcame
          obstacles</p>

        <h4>6. Stay Consistent and Be Patient</h4>
        <p>Consistency is the key to mastery. Dedicate a set amount of time each day to your coding journey, and be
          patient with yourself. Progress may be gradual, but it's a steady march toward improvement</p>

        <h4>7. Document Your Progress</h4>
        <p>Consider creating a coding journal or blog to document your journey. Not only does this help you reflect on
          how far you've come, but it also serves as a valuable resource for others starting their coding adventure</p>

        <h3>Continuing the Journey</h3>
        <p>My coding journey has been a testament to the fact that anyone can learn to code with dedication and
          perseverance. So, why not embark on your coding adventure? Whether you're a student, a professional in a
          different field, or someone simply curious about coding, your potential is limitless</p>

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>In conclusion, my journey from a commerce graduate to a proficient coder underscores the power of passion and
          perseverance. I've shown that with determination, anyone can enter the world of coding, regardless of their
          background. Remember, it's not about where you start; it's about where you're headed</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The world of coding is waiting for you to make your mark. Start small, stay consistent, and never stop
          learning. The journey may have its challenges, but each step forward brings you closer to your goals. The
          digital landscape is vast, and there's room for everyone to contribute and create. Your coding journey begins
          now, and the possibilities are endless. The final thing I wanted to add is there was a time when I created my
